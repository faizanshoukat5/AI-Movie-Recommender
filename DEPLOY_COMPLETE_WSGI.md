# ðŸš€ Complete WSGI Deployment for PythonAnywhere

## Issue: Frontend "Error fetching models: Failed to fetch models"

The frontend is trying to fetch models but the `/models` endpoint and several other endpoints are missing from the PythonAnywhere deployment.

## Solution: Deploy Complete WSGI File

### Step 1: Replace the WSGI file on PythonAnywhere

1. Go to PythonAnywhere Dashboard
2. Open **Files** tab
3. Navigate to `/home/fizu/AI-Movie-Recommender/`
4. Replace the `wsgi.py` file with the complete version from `wsgi_working.py`

### Step 2: Copy the Complete WSGI File

**Copy the entire contents of `wsgi_working.py` to your PythonAnywhere `wsgi.py` file.**

### Step 3: Restart the Web App

1. Go to **Web** tab in PythonAnywhere
2. Click **Reload fizu.pythonanywhere.com**

### Step 4: Test the New Endpoints

After deployment, these endpoints should work:

- âœ… `/health` - Health check
- âœ… `/models` - Get available models (THIS FIXES THE ERROR)
- âœ… `/movies` - Get all movies
- âœ… `/movies/random` - Get random movies
- âœ… `/search` - Search movies
- âœ… `/recommendations/{user_id}` - Get recommendations
- âœ… `/predict` - Predict rating
- âœ… `/compare/{user_id}` - Compare models
- âœ… `/users/{user_id}/ratings` - Get user ratings
- âœ… `/movies/{movie_id}/rate` - Rate movie

### Step 5: Verify Frontend Works

After deployment, the frontend should:
- âœ… Load without "Error fetching models" error
- âœ… Display model selection dropdown
- âœ… Show movies and recommendations
- âœ… Allow rating and predictions

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test models endpoint (should work after deployment)
curl https://fizu.pythonanywhere.com/models

# Test other endpoints
curl https://fizu.pythonanywhere.com/movies
curl https://fizu.pythonanywhere.com/search?q=star
curl https://fizu.pythonanywhere.com/recommendations/1
```

## ðŸŽ¯ This Will Fix the "Error fetching models" Issue

The frontend error occurs because:
1. Frontend tries to fetch `/models` endpoint on app load
2. PythonAnywhere deployment is missing this endpoint
3. The fetch fails and shows "Error fetching models: Failed to fetch models"

After deploying the complete WSGI file, all endpoints will be available and the frontend will work perfectly.
