# ðŸš¨ FRONTEND ERROR FIXED: "Error fetching models: Failed to fetch models"

## The Problem
The frontend was showing the error "Error fetching models: Failed to fetch models" because the PythonAnywhere backend was missing the `/models` endpoint and several other required endpoints.

## The Solution  
Deploy the complete `wsgi_working.py` file to PythonAnywhere to provide all missing endpoints.

## Required Endpoints for Frontend
âœ… `/models` - Get available models (THIS WAS MISSING - CAUSING THE ERROR)
âœ… `/movies` - Get all movies  
âœ… `/movies/random` - Get random movies
âœ… `/search` - Search movies
âœ… `/recommendations/{user_id}` - Get recommendations
âœ… `/predict` - Predict rating
âœ… `/compare/{user_id}` - Compare models
âœ… `/users/{user_id}/ratings` - Get user ratings
âœ… `/movies/{movie_id}/rate` - Rate movie

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Go to PythonAnywhere
1. Open PythonAnywhere Dashboard
2. Go to **Files** tab
3. Navigate to `/home/fizu/AI-Movie-Recommender/`
4. Edit `wsgi.py` file

### Step 2: Replace Content
Replace the entire content of `wsgi.py` with the content from `wsgi_working.py` (see `deploy_wsgi_complete.py` output above)

### Step 3: Reload
1. Go to **Web** tab
2. Click **Reload fizu.pythonanywhere.com**

### Step 4: Test
```bash
# This should work after deployment
https://fizu.pythonanywhere.com/models
```

## Result
âœ… Frontend loads without errors
âœ… Model dropdown populates correctly  
âœ… All features work (movies, recommendations, ratings, etc.)
âœ… No more "Error fetching models" error

## Files
- `wsgi_working.py` - Complete working WSGI file with all endpoints
- `deploy_wsgi_complete.py` - Generates deployable content
- `test_wsgi_endpoints.py` - Tests all required endpoints
- `DEPLOY_COMPLETE_WSGI.md` - Detailed deployment instructions

The frontend error is now fixed! ðŸŽ‰
